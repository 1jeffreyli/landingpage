# Landing Page
This is a landing page project according to The Odin Project (TOP) [guidelines](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/landing-page). 
**Note** This landing page project is not meant to be responsive. 

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to apply HTML and CSS concepts I've learned through TOP into practice. Specifically, this project should demonstrate my understanding of Flexbox and its properties.

## Learning Outcomes
A few things I learned by building and coding this project are:
- Always being aware of what div element is a flex container and what are its flex items, if any.
- Being aware of proper spacing.
- How to use 'git pull' to work on the repository across two different devices at different times.
- Setting the body's margin to 0 in order to remove the small whitespace along the edges of the page.

## Image
The image used as a placeholder was taken by me in a neighborhood in Daegu, South Korea.
